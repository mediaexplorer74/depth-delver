# depth-delver 1.0-prealpha
![Logo](Images/logo.png)

"UWP-Remake" of ITCH.io Depth Delver, fun game project. :)

## State / Status of R.E.
- Damaged / Draft (MonoGame.Extended malfunction + bugs in LD57 lib...)


## My 2 cents
-  NET -> UWP
- Min. Win. SDK = 10240 

## Solution structure (architecture)
- Depth_Delver "App starter" (in general, LD57 "wrapper") & Game content (xnb)
- LD57 Kernel game lib 
- MonoGame.Extended Experimental part of project (the goal is to improve/debug this "uwp-fork" of famous lib) 

## ToDo
- Fix 100500 bugs (main goal is to made success of depth-delver game-runnning)
- Add touchpanel support (fow old sweet win-phones/ win-tanblets/UMPCs...)
